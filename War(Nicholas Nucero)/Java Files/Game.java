        //Possible error scenarios:
        //1. In the event player 1 has 2 cards, player 2 has 3 cards, and they enter a war via a tie, player 2 will not have enough cards to fulfill
        //the war.
        //2. In the event that a tie occurs between the first card and both of the second two flipped cards (3 ties in a row (1/14)^3 or 1/2744 
        //probability of occurring) then the program would not be able to handle past this amount of ties. However, due to the probability of this
        //event being so low I determined that I did not need to handle beyond past 3 ties in a row for the scope of this project. I handle this
        //scenario by letting both sides keep their cards if this occurs.
